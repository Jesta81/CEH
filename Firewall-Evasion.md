q1. Jamie needs to keep data safe in a large datacenter, which is in desperate need of a firewall replacement for the end of life firewall. The director has asked Jamie to select and deploy an appropriate firewall for the existing datacenter. The director indicates that the amount of throughput will increase over the next few years and this firewall will need to keep up with the demand while other security systems do their part with the passing data. What firewall will Jamie use to meet the requirements?


1. Application-level proxy firewall because unlike the old packet filtering firewall technology, it can adjust speed based on applications.

2. [x] Packet filtering firewall because it will best keep the increased traffic moving at an acceptable level.

3. Packet filtering firewall because layer 7 inspections use less overhead, allowing more packets to be inspected per second than other firewall types.

4. Application-level proxy firewall because the connection between internal and external systems are inspected but not broken; data moves more rapidly.

Explanation:

    Performance is the key focus of the question; therefore, the test taker will have to focus on the real need of the most enterprise businesses and not get distracted by other slower firewall types. Packet filtering firewall may seem old school to less experienced test takers and they may immediately choose other options.
     Packet filtering firewalls are best performing of the choices.
