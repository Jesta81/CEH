# Cloud Computing. 

> Cloud computing is an on-demand delivery of **IT capabilities** where IT infrastructure and applications are provided to **subscribers** as a metered service over a network. 


## Characteristics of Cloud Computing.

> ### On-Demand self-service: 
> 
> - A type of service rendered by cloud service providers that allow provisions for cloud resources, such as computing power, storage, and network, always on-demand, without the need for human interaction with the service providers. 


> ### Distributed storage: 
>
> - Distributed storage in the cloud offers better scalability, availability, and reliability of data. However, cloud distributed storage can potentially raise security and compliance concerns.  


> ### Rapid elasticity: 
>
> - The cloud offers instant provisioning of capabilities to rapidly scale up or down, according to demand. To the consumers, the resources available for provisioning seem to be unlimited and can be purchased in any quantity at any point of time.  

> ### Automated management: 
>
> - By minimizing user involvement, cloud automation speeds up the process and reduces labor costs and the possibility of human error.  

> ### Broad network access: 
>
> - Cloud resources are available over the network and accessed through standard procedures via a wide variety of platforms, including laptops, mobile phones, and personal digital assistants (PDAs).  

> ### Resource pooling: 
>
> - The cloud service provider pools all the resources together to serve multiple customers in the multi-tenant environment, with physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned on demand by the consumer of the cloud.  

> ### Measured service: 
>
> - Cloud systems employ the “pay-per-use” metering method. Subscribers pay for cloud services by monthly subscription or according to the usage of resources such as storage levels, processing power, and bandwidth. Cloud service providers monitor, control, report, and charge consumption of resources by customers with complete transparency.  

> ### Virtualization technology: 
>
> - Virtualization technology in the cloud enables the rapid scaling of resources in a way that non-virtualized environments cannot achieve.  


## Types of Cloud Computing Services.

### Infrastructure-as-a-Service (Iass):  

> - This cloud computing service enables subscribers to use on-demand fundamental IT resources, such as computing power, virtualization, data storage, and network. This service provides virtual machines and other abstracted hardware and operating systems (OSs), which may be controlled through a service application programming interface (API). As cloud service providers are responsible for managing the underlying cloud computing infrastructure, subscribers can avoid costs of human capital, hardware, and others (e.g., Amazon EC2, Microsoft OneDrive, Rackspace).  

### Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS):  

> - This type of cloud computing service allows for the development of applications and services. Subscribers need not buy and manage the software and infrastructure underneath it but have authority over deployed applications and perhaps application hosting environment configurations. This offers development tools, configuration management, and deployment platforms on-demand, which can be used by subscribers to develop custom applications (e.g., Google App Engine, Salesforce, Microsoft Azure). Advantages of writing applications in the PaaS environment include dynamic scalability, automated backups, and other platform services, without the need to explicitly code for them.
