# Cloud Computing. 

> Cloud computing is an on-demand delivery of **IT capabilities** where IT infrastructure and applications are provided to **subscribers** as a metered service over a network. 


## Characteristics of Cloud Computing.

> ### **On-Demand self-service**. 
> 
> - A type of service rendered by cloud service providers that allow provisions for cloud resources, such as computing power, storage, and network, always on-demand, without the need for human interaction with the service providers. 


> ### **Distributed storage**. 
>
> - Distributed storage in the cloud offers better scalability, availability, and reliability of data. However, cloud distributed storage can potentially raise security and compliance concerns.  


> ### **Rapid elasticity**. 
>
> - The cloud offers instant provisioning of capabilities to rapidly scale up or down, according to demand. To the consumers, the resources available for provisioning seem to be unlimited and can be purchased in any quantity at any point of time.  

> ### **Automated management**. 
>
> - By minimizing user involvement, cloud automation speeds up the process and reduces labor costs and the possibility of human error.  

> ### **Broad network access**. 
>
> - Cloud resources are available over the network and accessed through standard procedures via a wide variety of platforms, including laptops, mobile phones, and personal digital assistants (PDAs).  

> ### **Resource pooling**. 
>
> - The cloud service provider pools all the resources together to serve multiple customers in the multi-tenant environment, with physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned on demand by the consumer of the cloud.  

> ### **Measured service**. 
>
> - Cloud systems employ the “pay-per-use” metering method. Subscribers pay for cloud services by monthly subscription or according to the usage of resources such as storage levels, processing power, and bandwidth. Cloud service providers monitor, control, report, and charge consumption of resources by customers with complete transparency.  

> ### **Virtualization technology**. 
>
> - Virtualization technology in the cloud enables the rapid scaling of resources in a way that non-virtualized environments cannot achieve.
