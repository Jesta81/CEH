3. Mat, a software engineer, received an email from his colleague John, stating that project files were missing from his system and asking Mat to send them to his personal email. Mat was suspicious and called John on his personal number. To his surprise, John replied that he has never written an email recently to Mat.

	Which of the following types of attacks was Mat subjected to?


	1. Consensus
	2. [x] Intimidation
	3. Scarcity
	4. Authority

	 Explanation:

    Authority: Authority implies the right to exercise power in an organization. Attackers take advantage of this by presenting themselves as a person of authority, such as a technician or an executive, in a target organization to steal important data
    Scarcity: Scarcity implies the state of being scarce. In the context of social engineering, scarcity often implies creating a feeling of urgency in a decision-making process. Due to this urgency, attackers can control the information provided to victims and manipulate the decision-making process
    Intimidation: Intimidation refers to an attempt to intimidate a victim into taking several actions by using bullying tactics. It is usually performed by impersonating some other person and manipulating users into disclosing sensitive information.
    Consensus: Consensus or social proof refers to the fact that people are usually willing to like things or do things that other people like or do


4. Jacob Hacker wants to infect the network of a competitor with a worm virus. He sets the worm to autoexecute and loads 50 copies of the worm onto 50 separate USB drives. He drives to the competitor’s campus and drops the USB keys at various locations around the campus. He waits for random employees to pick it up and who might check to see what is on them by plugging them into their computer. Once an employee has inserted the key, the worm autoexecutes and the network is infected.

	What type of attack is described here?


	1. [x] Social engineering
	2. Brute force attack
	3. Virus attack
	4. Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack

	 Explanation:

    Social engineering is correct. Even though a worm is used as the final attack, human manipulation is used to get the competitor’s employees to insert the USB keys. People are curious and this attack takes advantage of that. The other answers are distractors with DDoS being a pure network attack and brute force being a password cracking hack.


5. Jack a malicious hacker wants to break into Brown Co.’s computers and obtain their secret information related to Company’s quotations.

	 Explanation:

    Phishing: Phishing is a technique in which an attacker sends an email or provides a link falsely claiming to be from a legitimate site in an attempt to acquire a user’s personal or account information. The attacker registers a fake domain name, builds a lookalike website, and then mails the fake website’s link to several users. When a user clicks on the email link, it redirects him/her to the fake webpage, where he/she is lured to share sensitive details such as address and credit card information without knowing that it is a phishing site.
    Impersonation: Impersonation is a common human-based social engineering technique where an attacker pretends to be a legitimate or authorized person. Attackers perform impersonation attacks personally or use the phone or other communication medium to mislead target and trick them into revealing information.
    Vishing: Vishing (voice or VoIP phishing) is an impersonation technique in which attacker uses Voice over IP (VoIP) technology to trick individuals into revealing their critical financial and personal information and uses the information for his/her financial gain.
    Eavesdropping: Eavesdropping refers to an unauthorized person listening to a conversation or reading others’ messages. It includes interception of any form of communication, including audio, video, or written, using channels such as telephone lines, email, and instant messaging.

	Identify the type of insider threat discussed in the above scenario.


	1. [x] Accidental insider
	2. Compromised insider
	3. Malicious insider
	4. Professional insider

	 Explanation:

    Malicious Insider: Malicious Insider Threats: Malicious insider threats come from disgruntled or terminated employees who steal data or destroy company networks intentionally by injecting malware into the corporate network.
    Professional Insider: Professional insiders are the most harmful insiders. They use their technical knowledge to identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the company’s network and sell the organization’s confidential information to competitors or black-market bidders.
    Compromised Insider: An outsider compromises an insider who has access to the critical assets or computing devices of an organization. This type of threat is more difficult to detect since the outsider masquerades as a genuine insider.
    Accidental Insider: Accidental insider threats occur from the inadvertent exposure of confidential details to an external entity. Mistyping an email address, sending a valuable business document to an unknown user, unintentionally clicking on a malicious hyperlink, downloading a virus-infected file in a phishing email, and inadvertently disposing important papers are a few examples of accidental insider threats.
