## Cloud Computing Concepts ##


1. Which of the following cloud services provides features such as single sign-on, multi-factor authentication, identity governance and administration, access management, and intelligence collection?

**IDaaS**

 Explanation:

    Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS): This cloud computing service enables subscribers to use on-demand fundamental IT resources, such as computing power, virtualization, data storage, and network. This service provides virtual machines and other abstracted hardware and operating systems (OSs), which may be controlled through a service application programming interface (API). As cloud service providers are responsible for managing the underlying cloud computing infrastructure, subscribers can avoid costs of human capital, hardware, and others (e.g., Amazon EC2, GoGrid, Microsoft OneDrive, Rackspace).
    Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS): This type of cloud computing service allows for the development of applications and services. Subscribers need not buy and manage the software and infrastructure underneath it but have authority over deployed applications and perhaps application hosting environment configurations. This offers development tools, configuration management, and deployment platforms on-demand, which can be used by subscribers to develop custom applications (e.g., Google App Engine, Salesforce, Microsoft Azure). Advantages of writing applications in the PaaS environment include dynamic scalability, automated backups, and other platform services, without the need to explicitly code for them.
    Software-as-a-Service (SaaS): This cloud computing service offers application software to subscribers on-demand over the Internet. The provider charges for the service on a pay-per-use basis, by subscription, by advertising, or by sharing among multiple users (e.g., web-based office applications like Google Docs or Calendar, Salesforce CRM, and Freshbooks).
    Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS): This cloud computing service offers authentication services to the subscribed enterprises and is managed by a third-party vendor to provide identity and access management services. It provides services such as Single-Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor-Authentication (MFA), Identity Governance and Administration (IGA), access management, and intelligence collection. These services allow subscribers to access sensitive data more securely both on and off-premises (e.g., OneLogin, Centrify Identity Service, Microsoft Azure Active Directory, Okta).

10. Which of the following NIST cloud reference architecture factors manages cloud services in terms of use, performance, and delivery, and who also maintains a relationship between cloud providers and consumers?

**Cloud broker**

 Explanation:

    Cloud Consumer: A cloud consumer is a person or organization that maintains a business relationship with cloud service providers and uses cloud computing services. The cloud consumer browses the CSP’s service catalog requests for the desired services, sets up service contracts with the CSP (either directly or via cloud broker) and uses the service.
    Cloud Provider: A cloud provider is a person or organization who acquires and manages the computing infrastructure intended for providing services (directly or via a cloud broker) to interested parties via network access.
    Cloud Broker: Integration of cloud services is becoming too complicated for cloud consumers to manage. Thus, a cloud consumer may request cloud services from a cloud broker, rather than directly contacting a CSP. The cloud broker is an entity that manages cloud services regarding use, performance, and delivery, and maintains the relationship between CSPs and cloud consumers.
    Cloud Carrier: A cloud carrier acts as an intermediary that provides connectivity and transport services between CSPs and cloud consumers. The cloud carrier provides access to consumers via a network, telecommunication, and other access devices.
