# Iot Concepts 

The IoT is an important and emerging topic in the field of technology, economics, and society in general. It is referred to as the web of connected devices, made possible by the intersection between machine-to-machine communications and big data analytics. The IoT is a future-facing development of the Internet and abilities of physical devices that are gradually narrowing the gap between the virtual and physical world. This section deals with some of the important IoT concepts that one should be familiar with to understand the advanced topics covered later in this module.

## What is the IoT? 

> - Internet of Things (IoT), also known as **Internet of Everything (IoE)**, refers to the network of devices having IP addresses and the capability to sense, collect, and send data using embedded sensors, communication hardware and processors. 
>
> - In IoT, the term **thing** is used to refer to a device that is **implanted on natural, human-made, or machine-made objects** and has the functionality of **communicating over the network**. 

## How the IoT Works 

![IoT Workings](/IoT-and-OT-Hacking/IoT-Concepts/images/IoT-workings.png) 

> - IoT technology includes four primary systems: 
>>
>> 1. ### Sensing Technology 
>> - Sensors embedded in the devices sense a wide variety of information from their surroundings, including temperature, gases, location, workings of some industrial machinery, or health data of a patient. 
>>
>> 2. ### IoT Gateways 
>> - Gateways are used to bridge the gap between an IoT device (internal network) and the end-user (external network), thus allowing them to connect and communicate with each other. The data collected by the sensors in the IoT device is sent to the connected user or cloud through the gateway. 
>>
>> 3. ### Cloud Server/Data Storage 
>> - After traveling through the gateway, the collected data arrives at the cloud, where it is stored and undergoes data analysis. The processed data is then transmitted to the user, who can take certain actions based on the information received. 
>>
>> 4. ### Remote Control using Mobile App 
>> - The end-user uses remote controls such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, etc. installed with a mobile app to monitor, control, retrieve data, and take a specific action on IoT devices from a remote location. 


## IoT Architecture

![IoT Architecture](/IoT-and-OT-Hacking/IoT-Concepts/images/IoT-architecture.png) 

> - The IoT architecture includes several layers, from the Application layer at the top to the Edge Technology layer at the bottom. These layers are designed in such a way that they can meet the requirements of various sectors, including societies, industry, enterprises, governments, etc. 

>> ### Iot Architecture Layers 
>>
>> 1. #### Edge Technology Layer 
>> - This layer consists of all the hardware components, including sensors, radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, readers, or other soft sensors, and the device itself. These entities are the primary part of the data sensors that are deployed in the field for monitoring or sensing various phenomena. This layer plays an important part in data collection, and in connecting devices within the network and with the server. 
>>
>> 2. #### Access Gateway Lay 
>> - This layer helps to bridge the gap between two endpoints, such as a device and a client. The initial data handling also takes place in this layer. This layer carries out message routing, message identification, and subscribing. 
>>
>> 3. #### Internet Layer
>> - This is a crucial layer as it serves as the main component in carrying out communication between two endpoints, such as device-to-device, device-to-cloud, device-to-gateway, or back-end data sharing. 
>>
>> 4. #### Middleware Layer 
>> - This is one of the most critical layers that operates in two-way mode. As the name suggests, this layer sits in the middle of the application layer and the hardware layer, thus behaving as an interface between these two layers. It is responsible for important functions such as data management, device management, and various issues like data analysis, data aggregation, data filtering, device information discovery, and access control. 
>>
>> 5. #### Application Layer
>> - This layer, placed at the top of the stack, is responsible for the delivery of services to the relevant users from different sectors, including building, industrial, manufacturing, automobile, security, healthcare, etc.
