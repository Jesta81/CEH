# Iot Concepts 

The IoT is an important and emerging topic in the field of technology, economics, and society in general. It is referred to as the web of connected devices, made possible by the intersection between machine-to-machine communications and big data analytics. The IoT is a future-facing development of the Internet and abilities of physical devices that are gradually narrowing the gap between the virtual and physical world. This section deals with some of the important IoT concepts that one should be familiar with to understand the advanced topics covered later in this module.

## What is the IoT? 

> - Internet of Things (IoT), also known as **Internet of Everything (IoE)**, refers to the network of devices having IP addresses and the capability to sense, collect, and send data using embedded sensors, communication hardware and processors. 
>
> - In IoT, the term **thing** is used to refer to a device that is **implanted on natural, human-made, or machine-made objects** and has the functionality of **communicating over the network**. 

## How the IoT Works 

![IoT Workings](/IoT-and-OT-Hacking/IoT-Concepts/images/IoT-workings.png) 

> - IoT technology includes four primary systems: 
>>
>> 1. ### Sensing Technology 
>> - Sensors embedded in the devices sense a wide variety of information from their surroundings, including temperature, gases, location, workings of some industrial machinery, or health data of a patient. 
>>
>> 2. ### IoT Gateways 
>> - Gateways are used to bridge the gap between an IoT device (internal network) and the end-user (external network), thus allowing them to connect and communicate with each other. The data collected by the sensors in the IoT device is sent to the connected user or cloud through the gateway. 
>>
>> 3. ### Cloud Server/Data Storage 
>> - After traveling through the gateway, the collected data arrives at the cloud, where it is stored and undergoes data analysis. The processed data is then transmitted to the user, who can take certain actions based on the information received. 
>>
>> 4. ### Remote Control using Mobile App 
>> - The end-user uses remote controls such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, etc. installed with a mobile app to monitor, control, retrieve data, and take a specific action on IoT devices from a remote location. 


## IoT Architecture

![IoT Architecture](/IoT-and-OT-Hacking/IoT-Concepts/images/IoT-architecture.png) 

> - The IoT architecture includes several layers, from the Application layer at the top to the Edge Technology layer at the bottom. These layers are designed in such a way that they can meet the requirements of various sectors, including societies, industry, enterprises, governments, etc.

As the name suggests, this layer sits in the middle of the application layer and the hardware layer, thus behaving as an interface between these two layers. It is responsible for important functions such as data management, device management, and various issues like data analysis, data aggregation, data filtering, device information discovery, and access control. 
>>
>> 5. #### Application Layer
>> - This layer, placed at the top of the stack, is responsible for the delivery of services to the relevant users from different sectors, including building, industrial, manufacturing, automobile, security, healthcare, etc.

## IoT Communication Models 

![IoT Communication Models](/IoT-and-OT-Hacking/IoT-Concepts/images/IoT-Comm.png) 

IoT technology uses various technical communication models, each with its own characteristics. These models highlight the flexibility with which IoT devices can communicate with each other or with the client. Discussed below are four communication models and the key characteristics associated with each model: 

1. ### Device-to-Device Communication Model 

![Device-to-Device](/IoT-and-OT-Hacking/IoT-Concepts/images/device-to-device.png) 

> - In this type of communication, inter-connected devices interact with each other through the Internet. 
>
> - They predominantly use protocols such as ZigBee, Z-Wave or Bluetooth. 
>
> - Device-to-device communication is most commonly used in smart home devices such as thermostats, light bulbs, door locks, CCTV cameras, and fridges, which transfer small data packets to each other at a low data rate. 
>
> - This model is also popular in communication between wearable devices. For example, an ECG/EKG device attached to the body of a patient will be paired to his/her smartphone and will send him/her notifications during an emergency.

2. ### Device-to Cloud Communication Model 

![Device-to-Cloud](/IoT-and-OT-Hacking/IoT-Concepts/images/device-to-cloud.png) 

> - In this type of communication, devices communicate with the cloud directly, rather than directly communicating with the client to send or receive data or commands. 
>
> - It uses communication protocols such as Wi-Fi or Ethernet, and sometimes uses Cellular as well. 
>
> - An example of Wi-Fi-based device-to-cloud communication is a CCTV camera that can be accessed on a smartphone from a remote location. In this scenario, the device (here, the CCTV camera) cannot directly communicate with the client; rather, it first sends data to the cloud, and then, if the client inputs the correct credentials, he/she is then allowed to access the cloud, which in turn allows him/her to access the device at his/her home. 

3. ### Device-to-Gateway Communication Model 

![Device-to-Gateway](/IoT-and-OT-Hacking/IoT-Concepts/images/device-to-gateway.png) 

> - In the device-to-gateway communication model, the IoT device communicates with an intermediate device called a gateway, which in turn communicates with the cloud service. 
>
> - This gateway device could be a smartphone or a hub that is acting as an intermediate point, which also provides security features and data or protocol translation. 
>
>> 1. #### ZigBee
>> 2. #### Z-Wave

4. ### Back-End Data-Sharing Communication Model

![Back-End Data-Sharing](/IoT-and-OT-Hacking/IoT-Concepts/images/backend-data-sharing.png) 

> - This type of communication model extends the device-to-cloud communication type such that the data from the IoT devices can be accessed by authorized third parties. 
>
> - Here, devices upload their data onto the cloud, which is later accessed or analyzed by third parties. 
>
> - An example of this model would be an analyzer of the yearly or monthly energy consumption of a company. Later, the analysis can be used to reduce the companyâ€™s expenditure on energy by following certain energy-harvesting or saving techniques. 


## Challenges of IoT

IoT technology is growing so quickly that it has become ubiquitous. With numerous applications and features but a lack of basic security policies, IoT devices are currently easy prey for hackers. In addition, upgrades to IoT devices have introduced new security flaws that can be easily exploited by hackers. To overcome this significant issue, manufacturing companies should consider security as the top priority, starting with planning and design, and up to deployment, implementation, management, and maintenance.

> - IoT devices lack encryption techniques during the transmission of data, which at times causes them to use certain protocols that transmit data in clear text in addition to having open ports. 
>
> 6. ### Coding Errors (Buffer Overflow): 
> - Most IoT devices today have embedded web services that are subject to the same vulnerabilities that are commonly exploited on web service platforms. 
>
> - As a result, updating such functionality may give rise to issues like buffer overflows, SQL injection, etc. within technology infrastructure. 
>
> 7. ### Storage Issues: 
> - IoT devices generally come with smaller data storage capacity, but the data collected and transmitted by the devices is limitless. 
>
> - Therefore, this gives rise to data storage, management, and protection issues. 
>
> 8. ### Difficult-to-Update Firmware and OS: 
> - Upgrading firmware is an essential step toward countering vulnerabilities in a device, but it may impair a deviceâ€™s functionality. 
>
> - For this reason, developers or manufacturers may hesitate or even refuse to provide product support or make adjustments during the development phase of their products. 
>
> 9. ### Interoperability Standard Issues: 
> - One of the biggest obstacles for IoT devices is the interoperability issue, which is key to the viability and long-term growth of the entire IoT ecosystem. 
>
> - The issues that arise due to lack of interoperability in IoT devices are the inability of manufacturers to test application programming interfaces (APIs) using common methods and mechanisms, their inability to secure devices using software from third parties, and their inability to manage and monitor devices using a common layer. 
>
> 10. ### Physical Theft and Tampering: 
> - Physical attacks on IoT devices include tampering with the devices to inject malicious code or files to make the devices work the way the attacker intends, or making hardware modifications to the devices. 
>
> - Counterfeiting the devices may also be an issue when proper physical protection is not present to shield the devices. 
>
> 11. ### Lack of Vendor Support for Fixing Vulnerabilities: 
> - The firmware of the devices has to be upgraded in order to protect the devices against certain vulnerabilities, but vendors are hesitant, or they usually refuse to get third-party access to their devices. 
>
> 12. ### Emerging Economy and Development Issues: 
> - With widespread opportunities for IoT devices in every field, multiple layers of complexity are added for policymakers. 
>
> - The new landscape introduced by these devices adds a new dimension for the policymakers, who have to design new blueprints and policies for IoT devices. 
>
> 13. ### Handling of Unstructured Data: 
> - An increase in the number of connected devices will increase the complexity of handling unstructured data as its volume, velocity, and variety increases. 
>
> - It is important for organizations to understand and determine which data is valuable and actionable.
