## Implementing a Zero-Trust Model for ICS/SCADA 

**OT networks** are becoming an increasingly attractive target for attackers to **disrupt ICS infrastructure**. To stay ahead of attackers, organizations must **implement proper security controls** and address vulnerabilities in advance to prevent sophisticated attacks. Most ICS networks are based on **legacy systems or hardware** that does not contain modern security systems or access controls, which makes them vulnerable to sophisticated attacks. **Implementing a zero-trust model in an ICS network** can allow an organization to provide **robust access management** for the legacy systems and the network. This also **enables comprehensive visibility** and **ensures the validation of all the applications, users, and devices on the ICS network**. 

![Zero Trust](/IoT-and-OT-Hacking/OT-Hacking/OT-Attack-Countermeasures/images/Zero-Trust.png) 


**Steps to Implement a Zero-Trust Model in an ICS Network**. 

> 1. ### Step 1: Defining the Network
>
>> - As the attack surface of an organization is constantly developing, it is challenging to secure the entire organization. 
>> - The implementation of the zero-trust approach must be initiated through **defining the attack surface by identifying the organizational assets, vulnerable data, and critical applications within the control centers or factory floors**. 
>>
> 2. ### Step 2: Mapping the Traffic 
>
>> - The overall network traffic flow must be mapped and documented for understanding **how the network devices and other resources interact**. 
>> - **Traffic mapping** allows the OT teams to gain **complete visibility of the network** and understand the **required security controls** for securing critical data and applications. 
>>
> 3. ### Step 3: Architecting the Network 
>
>> - **After understanding the traffic flows**, security analysts can implement a **zero-trust architecture (ZTA)** based on the business requirements. 
>> - It can be initiated with the introduction of a **next-generation firewall (NGFW)**, which can add a segmentation gateway for the surface that must be protected. 
>> - This will **enable additional access-control layers and internal evaluation for that surface**. 
>>
> 4. ### Step 4: Developing a ZT Policy 
>
>> - A zero-trust (ZT) policy must be implemented for **whitelisting users and devices** after architecting the network. 
>> - This allows security analysts to **define who, why, when, and what resources are to be accessed** inside an ICS network. 
>>
> 5. ### Step 5: Monitoring and Maintaining 
>
>> - In the final step, security analysts must ensure that the **zero-trust architecture (ZTA) can monitor the traffic as intended** so that they can gain valuable insights into the network and **manage the updates on all the network devices** as and when required. 
>>


## International OT Security Organizations 

As **OT** is being widely spread and **interconnected with IT**, security researchers need to be more cautious and implement **strong security policies** to strengthen the **OT networks**. Some global **cybersecurity organizations** are committed to **providing appropriate security policies** and insights into improving the security resilience of **critical infrastructures**.

## OT Security Solutions

![Security-Solutions](/IoT-and-OT-Hacking/OT-Hacking/OT-Attack-Countermeasures/images/Security-Solutions.png) 

- The industrial and corporate sectors are rapidly digitizing their operational value chain, giving access to OT devices from a broader range of the Internet. 

- The cost of managing security in the heavy industrial sectors is being largely overlooked, leading to several security challenges. Hence, it is considered safer for all the industrial sectors to invest in cybersecurity programs and solutions. 

- Cybersecurity professionals should deploy solutions by sensibly examining the recent cybersecurity challenges and requirements they face in the current trend that can be combined with suitable operational changes. Hence many incumbent OEM providers and start-ups have developed several recent tactics and technologies for protecting the OT environment. 

- As the heavy industries have a decentralized nature, the security solutions can be integrated into all technology-linked decisions across IT and OT. In addition, the second line of defense can be implemented by using Information Risk Management (IRM). Some industries also provide a third line of defense by implementing internal audit functions. 

- Some of the emerging technology solutions used by organizations to protect the OT environment are as follows. 

>
> 1. ### Firewalls 
>
>> - **Firewalls are used in a network for monitoring and controlling the incoming and outgoing network traffic**. 
>>
>> - Firewalls help in improving security controls by **inspecting the traffic that traverses the gateway between the OT and IT networks**. 
>>
>> - They can also help in identifying and blocking new threats. Thus, the **attacker can be limited from traversing between the networks after compromising a system**. 
>>
>> - It is also advisable to **employ the critical assets and systems in a DMZ away from the SCADA systems**. 
>>
>> - Security professionals can use tools such as **SCADAwall, Waterfall, and Palo Alto NGFW** for protecting the network. 
>>
>
> 2. ### Unified Identity and OT Access Management 
>
>> - Access management helps industries to **centralize certain operations** like adding, securing, changing, and removing user access to the OT systems. 
>>
>> - All this data is linked with the organization’s identity-management system, which can provide strong authentication. 
>>
>> - The access management helps minimize the attack risk by providing the least privileges to superuser accounts. This helps the security personnel to trace the critical assets and helps in identifying the attack sources. 
>> - Security professionals can use tools such as **OT Access, FireEye, etc.** for identifying and managing access to industrial systems. 
>>
>
> 3. ### Asset Inventory and Device Authorization 
>
>> - Asset inventory helps in **connecting only authorized devices to the OT network**, and it can detect all the connected devices. 
>>
>> - It can also **detect the vulnerabilities in the devices**, which are categorized based on the device manufacturer, version, and type. 
>>
>> - These tools can also be used to **identify faults in the connected devices in the network**, and it can also **enhance the efficiency of the device**. 
>>
>> - Security professionals can use tools such as **SCADAfence, CyberLens, Guardian, and Dragos** for asset inventory and device authorization. 
>>
>
> 4. ### OT Network Monitoring and Anomaly Detection 
>
>> - OT network monitoring is used for constantly monitoring the systems in industrial networks. 
>> 
>> - These monitoring tools help in **tracking the traffic in a non-invasive way**. These tools perform **anomaly detection**, which is the process of **identifying any malicious or unexpected events**. 
>>
>> - Most of these tools use **machine-learning algorithms** for easy detection and identification of malicious behaviors. 
>>
>> - Security professionals can use tools such as **SCADAfence, CyberLens, Guardian, and Dragos** for asset inventory and device authorization. 
>>
>
> 5. ### Decoys to Deceive Attackers 
>
>> - **Decoys are honeypots** used in the OT environment that incorporate deception technology to automate the creation of traps or decoys to lure the attackers into revealing their presence and activities. 
>>
>> - This adds an extra layer of protection from attackers trying to penetrate the industrial network. 
>>
>> - Security professionals can use tools such as ThreatDefend, Conpot, and GasPot to protect the network.
