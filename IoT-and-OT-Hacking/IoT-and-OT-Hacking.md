# IoT and OT Hacking

![IoT and OT Hacking](/IoT-and-OT-Hacking/images/overview.png) 

The Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved from the convergence of wireless technology, micro-electromechanical systems, micro-services, and the Internet. IoT solutions are applied in different sectors of industry, including healthcare, building management, agriculture, energy, and transportation. Many organizations are driving the IoT transformation. IoT devices, such as wearables, industrial appliances, connected electronic devices, smart grids, and smart vehicles, are becoming part of interconnected networks. These devices generate a huge amount of data that is collected, analyzed, logged, and stored on the networks.

The IoT has introduced a range of new technologies with associated capabilities into our daily lives. As the IoT is an evolving technology, the immaturity of technologies and services provided by various vendors will have a broad impact on organizations, leading to complex security issues. IoT security is difficult to ensure as the devices use simple processors and stripped-down operating systems that may not support sophisticated security approaches. Organizations using these devices as part of their network need to protect both the devices and the information from attackers.

As industrial companies are digitizing their industrial facilities to enhance operational efficiency through Internet connectivity and remote data access, they need to increasingly focus on cybersecurity to mitigate new threats and safety issues arising from the convergence of operational technology and information technology (OTâ€“IT). Organizations need to understand the landscape of cyber threats, industrial infrastructure, and business. Before implementing cybersecurity policies and controls, organizations need to identify and prioritize key risks and threats that will have the greatest impact on their business.
