## Cyber Threat Intelligence ##

**Cyber threat intelligence, usually known as CTI, is the collection and analysis of information about threats and adversaries and the drawing up of patterns that provide an ability to make knowledgeable decisions for preparedness, prevention, and response actions against various cyberattacks. It is the process of recognizing or discovering any “unknown threats” that an organization may face so that necessary defense mechanisms can be applied to avoid such occurrences. It involves collecting, researching, and analyzing trends and technical developments in the field of cyber threats (including cybercrime, hacktivism, and espionage). Any knowledge about threats that results in an organization’s planning and decision-making to handle it is a piece of threat Intelligence. The main aim of CTI is to make the organization aware of existing or emerging threats and prepare them to develop a proactive cybersecurity posture in advance of exploitation. This process, where unknown threats are converted into possibly known ones, helps to anticipate the attack before it can happen, and ultimately results in a better and more secure system. Thus, threat Intelligence is useful in achieving secure data sharing and global transactions among organizations.**


### 4 Types of Threat Intelligence. ###

#### 1. Strategic Threat Intelligence ####

**Strategic threat intelligence provides high-level information regarding cybersecurity posture, threats, details about the financial impact of various cyber activities, attack trends, and the impact of high-level business decisions. This information is consumed by the high-level executives and management of the organization, such as IT management and CISO.**


#### 2. Tactical Threat Intelligence ####

**Tactical threat intelligence plays a major role in protecting the resources of the organization. It provides information related to the TTPs used by threat actors (attackers) to perform attacks. The collection sources for tactical threat intelligence include campaign reports, malware, incident reports, attack group reports, and human intelligence, among other information.**


#### 3. Operational Threat Intelligence ####

**Operational threat intelligence provides information about specific threats against the organization. It provides contextual information about security events and incidents that help defenders disclose potential risks, provide greater insight into attacker methodologies, identify past malicious activities, and perform investigations on malicious activity in a more efficient way.**


#### 4. Technical Threat Intelligence ####

**Technical threat intelligence provides information about resources an attacker uses to perform an attack; this includes command and control channels, tools, and other items.**
