# Mobile Device Management

> - Mobile device management (MDM) is gaining considerable importance with the adoption of policies such as BYOD across organizations. The increasing number and types of mobile devices such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, and so on has made it difficult for enterprises to make policies and manage these devices securely. MDM is a policy that helps to handle such devices carefully while ensuring that they are secure. Companies use a kind of security software for the administration of all mobile devices connected to the enterprise network. 
>
> - Mobile Device Management (MDM) provides platforms for **over-the-air wired distribution of applications** and data and configuration settings for all types of mobile devices, including mobile phones, smartphones, and table computers. 
>
> - MDM helps in implementing **enterprise-wide policies** to reduce support costs, business discontinuity, and security risks. 
>
> - It helps system administrators to **deploy and manage software applications** across all enterprise mobile devices to secure, monitor, manage, and support mobile devices. 


## Basic features of MDM software

> - Uses a passcode for the device.

## Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) 

![BYOD](/Hacking-Mobile-Platforms/MDM/images/BYOD.png) 

> - Bring your own device (BYOD) refers to a policy that allows an employee to bring their **personal devices**, such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets, to their **workplace** and use them to access the organization’s resources by following the access privileges. 
>
> - The BYOD policy allows employees to use the devices that they are **comfortable with and best fits their preferences** and work purposes. 
>
>> ### BYOD Benefits 
>>
>> #### Increased Productivity 
>> 1. Employees become experts in using their personal devices and this increases their productivity. In addition, users tend to upgrade their personal devices with cutting-edge technologies so that the enterprise can benefit from the latest features (both software and hardware) of the device. 
>>
>> #### Employee Satisfaction 
>> 2. By implementing BYOD, employees use devices of their own choice, which they invest in themselves without the company’s involvement. Moreover, employees are more comfortable with their personal devices, as they contain both personal data and corporate data, thus eliminating the usage of multiple devices. 
>>
>> #### Work Flexibility 
>> 3. By practicing BYOD, employees can carry a single device to satisfy their personal and professional needs. Work that is usually done in the office can be done from anywhere in the world, as employees are provided with access to the corporate data. BYOD users have more freedom, as their companies do not impose strict rules that they would have to follow when using company property. BYOD replaces the traditional client-server model with a mobile and cloud-centric strategy, which can have far-reaching benefits. 
>>
>> #### Lower Costs 
>> 4. A business that adopts BYOD does not have to spend on devices but saves money, as employees purchase their own devices. In addition, the cost of data services shifts to employees who can take better care of their own property (device). 

![BYOD Risks](/Hacking-Mobile-Platforms/MDM/images/BYOD-risks.png) 
>> ### BYOD Risks
>>
>> 1. Sharing **confidential data** on unsecured networks. 
>>
>> 2. Data leakage and **endpoint security issues**. 
>>
>> 3. Improperly **disposig of devices**. 
>>
>> 4. Support for many **different devices**. 
>>
>> 5. Mixing personal and **priavte data**. 
>>
>> 6. Lost or **stolen devices**. 
>>
>> 7. Lack of awareness. 
>>
>> 8. Ability to bypass organization's **network policies**. 
>>
>> 9. Infrastructure issues. 
>>
>> 10. Disgruntled employees. 


### BYOD Policy Implementation 

![BYOD Policy Implementation](/Hacking-Mobile-Platforms/MDM/images/BYOD-implementation.png) 

> 1. #### Define you requirements
>
> - Not all user requirements are alike. Thus, organize or group employees using mobile devices at work into segments considering job criticality, time sensitivity, value derived from mobility, data access, and systems access. It is best to define end user segments by the location/type of worker (e.g., employee working from home, full-time remote, day extender, part-time remote). Next, assign a technology portfolio for each segment, as per user needs. 
> - Perform a privacy impact assessment (PIA) at the very beginning of each BYOD project in the presence of all the relevant teams after assigning responsibilities and collecting the requirements. It provides an organized procedure to document facts, objectives, privacy risks, and risk mitigation approaches and decisions throughout the project life cycle. It should be a central activity performed by your mobile governance committee (end users from each segment/line of business and IT management). 
>
> 2. #### Select the devices of your choice and build a technology portfolio 
>
> - Decide how you want to manage your users and their data access. Apart from the MDM system that provides a minimum level of control, you may use other options such as virtual desktops or on-device software to improve security and data privacy. In addition, ensure that your corporate environment supports WLAN device connectivity and management. 
>
> 3. #### Develop policies 
>
> - A delegation of company resources (not just IT) should develop the policies. It should include key participants such as HR, legal, security, and privacy. 
>
> - The key components of a general BYOD policy are as follows: 
>> 1. Information security concerns. 
>> 2. Data protection concerns. 
>> 3. Confidentiality and ownership issues. 
>> 4. Information regarding any tracking/monitoring. 
>> 5. Considerations regarding the termination of employment. 
>> 6. Guidance regarding how to assess the security of Wi-Fi networks. 
>> 7. Acceptable and unacceptable behavior. 
>
> - Ensure that end users have a clear idea about the acceptable-use policy prior to entering a BYOD program. Finally, organizations must ensure that their BYOD policy is applicable against their employees and any third parties on their behalf, should the need arise, and follow through with its implementation. 
>
> 4. #### Security 
>
> - Mobile management technology is effective only when policies are established, implemented, and supported. It is essential for organizations to keep the mobile ecosystem adequately secure to make the BYOD programs work. This requires a thorough assessment of the operating environment and the development of a solution that provides for the following: asset and identity management, local storage controls, removable media controls, network access levels, network application controls, corporate versus personal app controls, web and messaging security, device health management, data loss prevention, and so on. 
>
> - Mainly consider assessing and documenting risks in the following aspects: 
>> 1. Information security (for data, application, and user segment). 
>> 2. Operations security (for protecting user information). 
>> 3. Transmission security (for secure data transmission). 
>
> 5. #### Support
>
> - The inconsistent nature of BYOD users will increase the frequency of support calls. Organizations should establish the process and capabilities in the early stages to ensure success. Mobile committees should frequently reassess the support levels and ensure the productivity of their mobile employees. 


### BYOD Security Guidelines

![BYOD Guidelines](/Hacking-Mobile-Platforms/MDM/images/BYOD-Guidelines.png) 

> 1. #### For the Administrator 
>
> - With the increasing use of tablets, smartphones, and other devices at work, mobile security has emerged as a major concern. Listed below are security guidelines that an administrator should follow to secure the organization’s network and data:
