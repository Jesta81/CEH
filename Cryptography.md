TEA
Serpent
Camellia
[x]GOST


3. Which of the following encryption algorithms is a Feistel cipher that uses 64 rounds as well as a 128-bit key operating on 64-bit blocks?


Twofish
Threefish
[x]TEA
Serpent


4. Which of the following symmetric-key block ciphers has either 18 rounds for 128-bit keys or 24 rounds for 256-bit keys and uses four 8 × 8-bit S-boxes that perform affine transformations and logical operations?

7. Some passwords are stored using specialized encryption algorithms known as hashes. Why is this an appropriate method?


Hashing is faster when compared to more traditional encryption algorithms.

If a user forgets the password, it can be easily retrieved using the hash key stored by administrators.

[x]Passwords stored using hashes are nonreversible, making finding the password much more difficult.

It is impossible to crack hashed user passwords unless the key used to encrypt them is obtained.



8. After gaining access to the password hashes used to protect access to a web-based application, the knowledge of which cryptographic algorithms would be useful to gain access to the application?


[x]SHA1
Diffie–Helman
AES
RSA


9. Which cipher encrypts the plain text digit (bit or byte) one by one?


Modern cipher
[x]Stream cipher
Block cipher
Classical cipher


10. Which property ensures that a hash function will not produce the same hashed value for two different messages?


Bit length
Key strength
Entropy
[x]Collision resistance


11. Which of the following is optimized for confidential communications, such as bidirectional voice and video?


MD5
[x]RC4
RC5
MD4


12. What is the primary drawback of using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm with a 256-bit key to share sensitive data?


It has been proven to be a weak cipher; therefore, should not be trusted to protect sensitive data.

To get messaging programs to function with this algorithm requires complex configurations.

[x]It is a symmetric key algorithm, meaning each recipient must receive the key through a different channel than the message.

Due to the key size, the time it will take to encrypt and decrypt the message hinders efficient communication.


13. When setting up a wireless network, an administrator enters a preshared key for security. Which of the following is true?


The key entered is based on the Diffie–Hellman method.
The key is an RSA key used to encrypt the wireless data.
[x]The key entered is a symmetric key used to encrypt the wireless data.
The key entered is a hash that is used to prove the integrity of the wireless data.


13. In a mode of authenticated encryption, the plaintext is first encrypted using a secret key. Then, a hash value is generated for the obtained cipher text and is attached to the cipher text before transmission. Identify this mode of authenticated encryption.

Encrypt-and-MAC (E&M)
MAC-then-Encrypt (MtE)
Authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD)
[x]Encrypt-then-MAC (EtM)


14. In a mode of authenticated encryption, a hash value is first generated for the plaintext. Then, both the plaintext and hash value are combined and encrypted with a secret key to produce cipher text. Identify this mode of authenticated encryption.

Authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD)
Encrypt-and-MAC (E&M)
Encrypt-then-MAC (EtM)
[x]MAC-then-Encrypt (MtE)



15. Which of the following is a decentralized and permission-less network in which anyone can join, create, and share blocks?


Private blockchain
Consortium blockchain
Hybrid blockchain
[x]Public ledger 


16. Identify the type of blockchain in which a supervisor or central authority decides who can join and participate in the blockchain network.


Federated blockchain
[x]Private ledger
Public blockchain
Hybrid blockchain


17. Which of the following is a partially decentralized blockchain in which a group of individuals or organizations create and manage separate blockchain networks?


Public ledger
Private blockchain
[x]Federated blockchain
Hybrid blockchain

18. Which of the following is an example of a public ledger or public blockchain that has no central authority or administration to manage the blocks or ledgers?


Ripple (XRP)
Hyperledger
[x]Ethereum
IBM Food Trust


19. Which of the following is an example of a private blockchain where a supervisor or central authority decides who can join and participate in the blockchain network?


Bitcoin
[x]Ripple (XRP)
IBM Food Trust
Ethereum
