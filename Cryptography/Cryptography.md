## Cryptography Concepts. 
>
> - Cryptography is the conversion of data into a scrambled code that is encrypted and sent across a private or public network. 
>
> - Cryptography is used to protect confidential data, such as email messages, chat sessions, web transactions, presonal data, corporate data, and e-commerce applications.


### Objectives of Cryptography. 

#### Confidentiality:  
>
> - Assurance that the information is accessible only to those authorized to access it.  

#### Integrity:  
>
> - Trustworthiness of data or resources in terms of preventing improper and unauthroized changes. 

#### Authentication:  
> 
> - Assurance that the communication, document, or data is genuine. 

#### Nonrepudiation:  
>
> - Guarantee that the sender of a message cannot later deny having sent the message and that the recipient cannot deny having received the message.

### Types of Cryptography:  

#### Symmetric Encryption. 
>
> - Symmetric encryption (secret-key, shared-key, and private-key) **uses the same key** for encryption as it does for decryption.

#### Asymmetric Encryption. 
>
> - Asymmetric encryption (public-key) **uses different encrption keys**, which are called public and private keys for encryption and decryption, respectely.

### Government Access to Keys (GAK). 
>
> - GAK means that sofware companies will give **copies of all keys** (or at least a sufficient proportion of each key that the remainder could be cracked) to the government. 
>
> - The government promises that they will hold on to the keys in a **secure manner** and will only use them when a **court issues a warrant** to do so. 
>
> - To the government, this is similar to the **ability to wiretapping phones**.
