## Information Security Overview ##

1. Which of the following techniques does an attacker use to snoop on the communication between users or devices and record private information to launch passive attacks?

	1. Session hijacking
	2. Privilege escalation
	3. Eavesdropping
	4. Spoofing

2. Which of the following techniques is a close-in attack where an attacker simply examines an organization’s trash for any discarded sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit-card statements, bank statements, ATM receipts, social security numbers, and private telephone numbers?


	1. [x] Dumpster diving
	2. Shoulder surfing
	3. Wiretapping
	4. Pod slurping

3. Which of the following close-in attacks is performed by an attacker to gather information by observing the target’s activity at the closest proximity?

	1. DNS spoofing
	2. [x] Shoulder surfing
	3. ARP poisoning
	4. Denial of service

4. Which of the following categories of information warfare involves the use of information systems against the virtual personas of individuals or groups and includes information terrorism, semantic attacks, and simula-warfare?


	1. Economic warfare
	2. Electronic warfare
	3. [x] Cyberwarfare
	4. Intelligence-based warfare

	 Explanation:

    Cyberwarfare: Libicki defines cyber warfare as the use of information systems against the virtual personas of individuals or groups. It is the broadest of all information warfare. It includes information terrorism, semantic attacks (similar to Hacker warfare, but instead of harming a system, it takes over the system while maintaining the perception that it is operating correctly), and simula-warfare (simulated war, for example, acquiring weapons for mere demonstration rather than actual use).
    Economic warfare: Libicki notes that economic information warfare can affect the economy of a business or nation by blocking the flow of information. This could be especially devastating to organizations that do a lot of business in the digital world.
    Intelligence-based warfare: Intelligence-based warfare is a sensor-based technology that directly corrupts technological systems. According to Libicki, “intelligence-based warfare” is warfare that consists of the design, protection, and denial of systems that seek sufficient knowledge to dominate the battlespace.
    Electronic warfare: According to Libicki, electronic warfare uses radio-electronic and cryptographic techniques to degrade the communication. Radio electronic techniques attack the physical means of sending information, whereas cryptographic techniques use bits and bytes to disrupt the means of sending information.


5. Sam, an attacker, was hired to launch an attack on an organization to disrupt its operations and gain access to a remote system for compromising the organization’s internal network. In the process, Sam launched an attack to tamper with the data in transit to break into the organization’s network.

	What is the type of attack Sam has performed against the target organization?


	1. Distribution attack
	2. Active attack
	3. Insider attack
	4. Passive attack

	 Explanation:

    Passive Attacks: Passive attacks do not tamper with the data and involve intercepting and monitoring network traffic and data flow on the target network
    Insider Attacks: Insider attacks involve using privileged access to violate rules or intentionally cause a threat to the organization’s information or information systems
    Distribution Attacks: Distribution attacks occur when attackers tamper with hardware or software prior to installation
    Active Attacks: Active attacks tamper with the data in transit or disrupt the communication or services between the systems to bypass or break into secured systems


6. Don, a professional hacker, was hired to break into an organization’s network and extract sensitive data. In the attack process, Don found that the organization has purchased new hardware. He accessed the new hardware while it was in transit and tampered with it to launch further attacks on the target organization.

	What is the type of attack Don has performed on the target organization?


	1. Active attack
	2. Passive attack
	3. [x] Distribution attack
	4. Insider attack


7. Which of the following fundamental elements of information security refers to an assurance that the information is accessible only to those authorized to have access?


	1. Authenticity
	2. Integrity
	3. Availability
	4. [x] Confidentiality


## Hacking Methodologies and Frameworks ##


1. James, a professional hacker, is performing an attack on a target organization. He succeeded in gathering information about the target and identified vulnerabilities existing in the target network. He is now in the process of exploiting the vulnerabilities to enter the target’s network and escalate privileges so that he can have complete access to the target system.

	Which of the following phases of hacking is James currently in?


	1. Maintaining access
	2. [x] Gaining access
	3. Reconnaissance
	4. Scanning


2. Given below are the various phases of the cyber kill chain methodology.

    1. Installation
    2. Reconnaissance
    3. Weaponization
    4. Exploitation
    5. Actions on objectives
    6. Delivery
    7. Command and control

What is the correct sequence of phases involved in the cyber kill chain methodology?

**2,3,6,4,1,7,5**

3. A phase of the cyber kill chain methodology triggers the adversary’s malicious code, which utilizes a vulnerability in the operating system, application, or server on a target system. At this stage, the organization may face threats such as authentication and authorization attacks, arbitrary code execution, physical security threats, and security misconfiguration.

	Which is this phase of the cyber kill chain methodology?


	1. Installation
	2. Weaponization
	3. Reconnaissance
	4. [x] Exploitation


4. Which of the following techniques does an adversary use to communicate remotely with compromised systems through an encrypted session, where the adversary can steal data, delete data, and launch further attacks through the encrypted channel?


	1. HTTP user agent
	2. Unspecified proxy activities
	3. Use of PowerShell
	4. [x] Command and control server


5. Which IoC category can be obtained by analyzing aspects of the infected system within the organizational network, such as filenames, file hashes, registry keys, DLLs, and mutex?


	1. Email indicators
	2. [x] Host-based indicators
	3. Network indicators
	4. Behavioral indicators
